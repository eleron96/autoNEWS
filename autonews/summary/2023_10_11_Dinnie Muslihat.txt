Enscape, a real-time visualization plugin, has recently released a service pack that enables real-time rendering and visualization within Archicad 27. This plugin seamlessly integrates with popular CAD/BIM applications, including Archicad, and has been supporting it since version 2.3.
Using Enscape with Archicad is a straightforward process. After downloading Enscape and connecting your license, you can open a 3D window in your Archicad project and click the 'open Enscape' button from the Enscape toolbar. This activates the real-time walkthrough mode, allowing you to explore your project and provide stakeholders with a clear understanding of the design.
The integration between Archicad and Enscape also allows you to generate various media formats, such as static images, 360-degree panoramas, and videos, for your project. Additionally, with just one click and a compatible VR headset, you can experience your project in virtual reality.
Enscape not only supports the latest Archicad 27 but also older versions like Archicad 26, 25, and 24. This powerful combination of Enscape and Archicad has proven to be a time-saving design solution, as demonstrated by Fulton Trotter Architects. They were able to deliver high-profile academic projects quickly, even amidst the challenges of the COVID lockdowns. Enscape facilitated the decision-making process, allowing clients to make quick decisions and implement changes immediately.
According to John Ward, Firm Director of Fulton Trotter Architects, the Archicad and Enscape workflow played a crucial role in their success. They were able to take a project from concept to planning application in just three months, thanks to the ability to showcase high-quality images and sell their designs effectively.
