In a recent blog post written by Jaime Rosales, the Autodesk Platform Services Community was informed about the deprecation of Authentication v1 for Autodesk Platform Services. However, in response to feedback from the community, the deprecation date has been extended to April 30th, 2024. This extension allows users more time to migrate their applications and workflows to Authentication v2.
Authentication has been an important service for Autodesk Platform Services, and the introduction of Authentication v2 brings enhancements such as PCKE support and new endpoints. It is crucial for users to complete their migration before the final date to avoid any disruptions to their services.
For existing apps, there are changes to the workflow, including the use of the new /token endpoint with ID and Secret for 2-legged workflows, and the use of the /authorize endpoint and obtained code with the /token endpoint for 3-legged workflows. A detailed migration guide is available to assist users through the process, and a dedicated support team is ready to provide assistance if needed.
The future looks promising with the innovations that Authentication v2 brings, and Autodesk Platform Services is grateful for the community's collaboration. It is important to act now to ensure a smooth transition before the final call for Authentication v1 on April 30th, 2024.
