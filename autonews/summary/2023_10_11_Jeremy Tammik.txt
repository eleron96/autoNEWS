In this engaging blog post by Jeremy Tammik, various topics related to BIM, geometry, pyRevit, and AI are discussed. The author starts by mentioning the dedicated pyRevit discussion forums for any pyRevit-related questions. Moving on, the author highlights the surprising fact that the BIM database does not store any geometry. Instead, the model we see is just a view of the elements, their relationships, parameters, and constraints. However, there are still tasks that require working with BIM element geometry, such as retrieving cut edges and getting touching elements. The author provides solutions and references to address these tasks. The concept of a stable representation of a reference is explained, which allows Revit to store information about references even if the geometry is gone. The author also shares a solution to retrieve CUT_EDGE references from walls using stable reference magic voodoo. The blog post concludes with brief mentions of Revit and IFC coordinate systems, deepfakes of Chinese influencers using AI, and the use and misuse of generative AI. Overall, the blog post provides valuable insights and practical solutions for various BIM-related tasks.
