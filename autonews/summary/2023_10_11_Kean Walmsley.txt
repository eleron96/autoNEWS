In his blog post, Kean Walmsley shares the highlights of his team's busy week. They had a virtual offsite where they used LEGO to brainstorm and plan for the upcoming year. Due to the pandemic, their original plans to hire a LEGO practitioner for team-building events had to be changed, and they decided to try "Serious Play" instead. 
The team also made great progress on their exhibition in Toronto, which will be followed by a showcase at AU 2023 in Las Vegas. Kean is excited about the exhibition and can't wait for people to see it.
Inspired by a recent conference in Munich, Kean has been working on integrating VASA into Forma. He wanted to test whether VASA would work for urban pathfinding using context geometry from Forma. He explored different approaches, including using Dynamo with STL output from Forma or directly using their WebAssembly package via Forma's Extension View SDK. Kean plans to share more details about this project in future blog posts.
Kean needed to finish the integration before recording a VASA class for AU, as he wanted to include a demo. He is satisfied with how it turned out and will share more about the process soon.
After the recording, Kean is looking forward to going on a vacation to Cinque Terre with his family. He has never been there before and plans to share pictures of the trip once they return.
