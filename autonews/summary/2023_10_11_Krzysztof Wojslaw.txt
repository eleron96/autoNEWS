In this engaging blog post, Krzysztof Wojslaw shares his personal journey of learning Python in the AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) industry. He always had a curiosity for programming and wanted to make tasks more efficient and enjoyable. However, the programming courses taught in university didn't align with his interests.
After completing his studies, he rediscovered programming and found Python to be a user-friendly language with a simple syntax. He learned the basics and even earned a certificate, feeling proud to say, "I can code in Python." However, he soon realized that knowing a programming language alone wasn't enough to apply it to his job in working with 3D models.
Feeling discouraged, Krzysztof took a break from programming. But then he discovered tools like Grasshopper and Rhino, which made coding fun again and showed him how it could enhance his work. He started using visual programming and became excited about speeding up tasks.
However, he also realized that visual programming had its limitations. To overcome them, he turned to text-based programming with Python. By combining his knowledge of Grasshopper with Python, he could create more efficient and concise code. This is when he truly started using Python for his work.
Krzysztof emphasizes the importance of learning programming in a relevant context. He advises beginners to learn using real job examples, such as using Grasshopper or Rhino to practice Python. He also suggests trying Python in other tools like Excel, even though it might feel slower at first.
In the end, Krzysztof shares a guide with practical applications of Python in the AEC industry, catering to various professionals like architects, BIM coordinators, structural engineers, and geotechnical engineers.
