In this blog post, Jeff Bartels introduces a multipart series on managing Civil 3D projects in the cloud. The previous session focused on creating new projects, uploading and viewing files, and accessing cloud content through web browsers or mobile devices. The upcoming session, scheduled for October 12th, will delve into controlling access to cloud projects by inviting members and assigning permissions. It will also explore initial collaborative workflows enabled by the cloud. Bartels encourages interested individuals to register for the live sessions.
