The latest version of Dynamo, version 2.19, brings exciting updates to the node and package search feature. The search functionality has been greatly improved, making it easier to find the nodes and packages you need. The new search is more likely to provide relevant results and can handle different ways of expressing a node's name, including typos. The search improvements are available in the node library, in-canvas search, node autocomplete, and package search.
In addition to the search updates, Dynamo 2.19 introduces new ways to identify package nodes, such as zoom states and tooltips. The Python editor experience has also been enhanced with a new way to edit Python scripts and improved alignment with DesignScript styles. The release also includes better documentation for chart nodes, a new shortcut for inserting graphs, the ability to drag and drop notes to pin them, and a setting to control whether exported image file names include a time stamp.
Dynamo 2.19 is available for download from dynamobuilds.com, and more information can be found in the release notes. The Dynamo community is encouraged to provide feedback and suggestions for future features.
