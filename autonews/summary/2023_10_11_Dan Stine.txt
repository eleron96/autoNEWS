In his blog post, Dan Stine discusses the enhancements made to the Coefficient of Utilization Calculation for Absolute Photometry in Revit 2019. While the previous issues with absolute photometry have been resolved, there are still some calculation mysteries to be aware of. Stine sets up four square spaces with different types of luminaires to explore these mysteries. He explains that the Coefficient of Utilization appears to be correct, with slight variations between the absolute and relative fixtures. However, there are still some remaining calculation mysteries, such as the dependence of the "Average Estimated Illumination" parameter on the "Initial Intensity" parameter, which can lead to confusion. Stine also points out the illogical difference in average illuminance between the "Relative" and "Relative-Bogus Lamp Lumens" cases. He compares the rendering of relative and absolute lighting fixtures in Revit and highlights the differences. Stine concludes by mentioning that Revit uses the Zonal Cavity Method for calculating average illuminance, which is only accurate for rectangular-shaped rooms. He suggests using a radiosity calculation for more accurate results. Despite these challenges, Stine acknowledges the progress made in addressing the issues with absolute photometry in Revit.
